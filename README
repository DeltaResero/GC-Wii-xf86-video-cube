* 1- Introduction
****************************************



This driver implements only the basics for the xserver to work with correct colours. It doesn't implements extensions
like GLX, or Xvideo (maybe in a future...). This work is based on the Xf86 glide driver, and has parts taken from
SDL-gclinux lib, fbdev xf86 driver and glide xf86 driver compatible with gc/wii-linux.

This driver supports:
- 640x480-16bpp screen configuration

This driver lacks:
- Other screen configurations...
- Xvideo, XGL, and any other X extension...
- Problems in PAL consoles: As pal draws in 640x576, you will see a green line in the bottom of the screen.
 To solve, put the video mode in 480i/p/60Hz.

****************************************
* 2- How to compile:
****************************************

You will need a gcc compiler, and the xserver-xorg development libraries and headers installed on your system. To build
the driver form source, uncompress the tarball with the sources, and type:

"./configure && make && make install"


****************************************
* 3- How to install:
****************************************

If you downloaded the precompiled binaries, you can install the driver manually.You need an already installed xorg-server
enviroment. Copy the contents inside the "bin" directory (cube_drv.so, cube_drv.la) to the xserver drivers directory
("/usr/local/lib/xorg/modules/drivers","/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers" or "/usr/X11R7/lib/xorg/modules/drivers"), and
configure the xserver to use this driver.


****************************************
* 4- How to configure "/etc/X11/xorg.conf":
****************************************

- Edit the file "/etc/X11/xorg.conf" and add a new video section:


Section "Device"
   Identifier    "WII/Gc Card"
   Driver        "cube"
EndSection


- Edit the module section, and leave it as this:

Section "Module"
   Load    "dbe"
   Load    "ddc"
   SubSection  "extmod"
     # Option    "omit xfree86-dga"
     # Option    "omit XFree86-VidModeExtension"
   EndSubSection
   Load        "type1"
   Load        "freetype"
   Load    "dri"
EndSection

Edit the screen section, and replace the next options:

Section "Screen"
        ....
        Device        "WII/Gc Card"
        ....
        DefaultDepth    16
        Subsection "Display"
                  Modes       "640x480"
        EndSubsection

EndSection

This driver was possible thanks to many other people previous work:

- Albert Herranz, for his SDL gamecube driver for wii-linux.
- Henrik Harmsen, for his glide Xfree86 driver which gave the basic structure.
- Alan Hourihane and Michel DÃ¤nzer, for their framebuffer xfree86 driver.
- All the gc-linux team, for their effort in porting linux to the gamecube/wii console
